## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0-rc2] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **SvelteKit admin UI** — full rewrite of admin panel as a SvelteKit app with
  server-side rendering, typed API routes, and Svelte 5 runes.
- **Setup wizard** — browser-based first-boot wizard that walks through provider
  connection, channel selection, and stack startup.
- **Connection profiles** — named LLM provider configurations (`connections/profiles.json`)
  with assignment to system, embedder, and channel roles via the admin UI and API.
- **Bun-based memory service** — replaced the Python/mem0 memory backend with a
  lightweight Bun.js service using sqlite-vec for vector storage. Removes the
  Python runtime dependency entirely.
- **Channels SDK** (`packages/channels-sdk/`) — `BaseChannel` abstract class,
  HMAC crypto helpers, structured logger, and typed payload definitions for
  building channel adapters.
- **Channel adapters** — web chat (`channel-chat`), OpenAI-compatible API
  (`channel-api`), and Discord (`channel-discord`) channels, each running as a
  standalone Docker container.
- **Guardian** (`core/guardian/`) — Bun HTTP server enforcing HMAC verification,
  timestamp skew rejection, replay detection, and rate limiting on all channel
  ingress traffic.
- **Automation scheduler** — in-process Croner-based scheduler on the admin
  container. Drop a YAML file into `automations/` to schedule API calls, HTTP
  requests, or shell commands on a cron expression.
- **XDG directory model** — three-tier filesystem layout (CONFIG_HOME /
  DATA_HOME / STATE_HOME) following the XDG Base Directory Specification.
  CONFIG_HOME is user-owned and never overwritten by automatic lifecycle
  operations.
- **Docker socket proxy** — admin accesses Docker via `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`
  over an isolated network instead of mounting the socket directly. Eliminates
  socket permission and GID issues across Docker Desktop, OrbStack, Colima, and
  Podman.
- **CLI** (`packages/cli/`) — cross-platform CLI for setup, status, and stack
  management. Builds native binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows via Bun.
- **One-line installer** — `setup.sh` (Mac/Linux) and `setup.ps1` (Windows)
  scripts that bootstrap the XDG directory tree, download core assets, generate
  an admin token, and start the stack.
- **Channel registry** — catalog of channel definitions in `registry/` bundled
  into the admin image. Channels are installed from the registry via API or by
  file-drop into CONFIG_HOME.
- **Assistant tools plugin** (`packages/assistant-tools/`) — OpenCode plugin
  providing stack management tools, memory integration, and operational skills
  to the assistant.

### Changed

- Admin API endpoints moved under `/admin/` prefix with `x-admin-token`
  authentication.
- Compose file uses `--env-file` flags instead of `.env` convention for
  explicit env file precedence.
- Memory API switched from REST to a filter-based query model
  (`POST /api/v1/memories/filter`) to work around upstream pagination issues.

### Security

- All channel traffic is HMAC-signed and validated by the guardian before
  reaching the assistant.
- Assistant container has no Docker socket access and communicates with the
  stack exclusively through the admin API.
- Admin panel and all dashboards are LAN-restricted by default (bound to
  `127.0.0.1`).
- Audit logging for admin operations (`admin-audit.jsonl`) and guardian
  requests (`guardian-audit.log`).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added

- Docker Compose orchestration for core services (Caddy, admin, assistant,
  guardian, memory).
- OpenCode integration as the assistant runtime with project-scoped config.
- Basic admin API for container lifecycle management (start, stop, restart,
  pull).
- Python-based memory service using mem0 for conversation history and context
  recall.
- Channel system foundation with compose overlay and Caddy route discovery.
- Caddy reverse proxy with automatic LAN/public network segmentation.
- Initial XDG directory structure with CONFIG_HOME and DATA_HOME tiers.
