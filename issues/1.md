**Feature request:** Update the installer workflow so that it only pulls and deploys containers for the channels the user chooses to enable during setup.

**Goal:**  
- Allow users to enable channels (e.g., chat, discord, telegram, voice) during setup.
- The installer should only pull and launch containers for enabled channels.
- Prevent unnecessary containers (e.g., `channel-telegram`) from being pulled and added to the compose file if the user doesn't want the Telegram integration.

**Benefits:**  
- Streamlined install and reduced resource usage.
- Avoid exposing unnecessary network endpoints for unused channels.
- Easier maintenance and improved security.

**Relevant code references:**

- PowerShell installer workflow: [scripts/install.ps1](https://github.com/itlackey/openpalm/blob/main/scripts/install.ps1)
- Shell installer workflow: [scripts/install.sh](https://github.com/itlackey/openpalm/blob/main/scripts/install.sh)
- Channel inventory: [docs/architecture.md](https://github.com/itlackey/openpalm/blob/main/docs/architecture.md#container-inventory)

**Suggested Implementation Steps**:
1. Update setup UI to let users choose which channels to enable.
2. Amend installer scripts (PowerShell and Shell) to:
    - Set up only selected channels' environment/config files.
    - Edit the compose file to only include containers corresponding to the enabled channels.
    - Pull/start only those containers.
3. Validate selected channels and ensure correct networking and environment variable setup.
4. Document changes so future maintainers/users understand the new selective setup flow.
