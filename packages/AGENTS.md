# Packages Workspace

## Most important rules
- Keep packages reusable and consistent across CLI/UI/Admin.
- Keep shared contracts centralized in `packages/lib`.
- Keep CLI/UI thin wrappers over stable lib/admin contracts.
- For new packages, update release/version workflow files listed in root `AGENTS.md`.

## Key links
- `packages/lib/AGENTS.md`
- `packages/cli/AGENTS.md`
- `packages/ui/AGENTS.md`
