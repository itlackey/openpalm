# Channels Workspace

## Most important rules
- Channels are ingress translators, not business-logic engines.
- Validate and normalize untrusted provider payloads at the edge.
- Forward assistant-bound traffic to Gateway only.
- Keep identifiers stable for auditability and idempotency.
- For new channels, update release/version workflow files listed in root `AGENTS.md`.
