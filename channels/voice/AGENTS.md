# Channel: Voice

## Most important rules
- Keep responsibilities to transport/session normalization and forwarding.
- Route assistant-bound traffic to Gateway only.
- Validate media/session metadata at ingress.
- Handle partial/interim events without duplicate final sends.
- Keep payload handling memory-conscious for large media events.
