Please explain the following to the user:

## What is the Ralph Wiggum Technique?

The Ralph Wiggum technique is an iterative development methodology based on continuous AI loops, pioneered by Geoffrey Huntley.

**Core concept:**
```bash
while :; do
  cat PROMPT.md | opencode --continue
done
```

The same prompt is fed to the agent repeatedly. The "self-referential" aspect comes from the agent seeing its own previous work in the files and git history, not from feeding output back as input.

**Each iteration:**
1. The agent receives the SAME prompt
2. Works on the task, modifying files
3. Session goes idle (completes)
4. The `ralph-wiggum` plugin intercepts the `session.idle` event and sends the same prompt again
5. The agent sees its previous work in the files
6. Iteratively improves until completion

The technique is described as "deterministically bad in an undeterministic world" - failures are predictable, enabling systematic improvement through prompt tuning.

## Available Commands

### /ralph-loop <PROMPT> [OPTIONS]

Start a Ralph loop in your current session.

**Usage:**
```
/ralph-loop "Refactor the cache layer" --max-iterations 20
/ralph-loop "Add tests" --completion-promise "TESTS COMPLETE"
```

**Options:**
- `--max-iterations <n>` - Max iterations before auto-stop
- `--completion-promise <text>` - Promise phrase to signal completion

**How it works:**
1. Creates `.opencode/ralph-loop.local.md` state file
2. You work on the task
3. When the session goes idle, the `ralph-wiggum` plugin intercepts via `session.idle`
4. Same prompt fed back via `client.session.prompt()`
5. You see your previous work in files and git history
6. Continues until promise detected or max iterations

### /cancel-ralph

Cancel an active Ralph loop (removes the loop state file).

**Usage:**
```
/cancel-ralph
```

**How it works:**
- Checks for active loop state file
- Removes `.opencode/ralph-loop.local.md`
- Reports cancellation with iteration count

## Key Concepts

### Completion Promises

To signal completion, Claude must output a `<promise>` tag:

```
<promise>TASK COMPLETE</promise>
```

The stop hook looks for this specific tag. Without it (or `--max-iterations`), Ralph runs infinitely.

### Self-Reference Mechanism

The "loop" doesn't mean Claude talks to itself. It means:
- Same prompt repeated
- Claude's work persists in files
- Each iteration sees previous attempts
- Builds incrementally toward goal

## Example

### Interactive Bug Fix

```
/ralph-loop "Fix the token refresh logic in auth.ts. Output <promise>FIXED</promise> when all tests pass." --completion-promise "FIXED" --max-iterations 10
```

You'll see Ralph:
- Attempt fixes
- Run tests
- See failures
- Iterate on solution
- In your current session

## When to Use Ralph

**Good for:**
- Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria
- Tasks requiring iteration and refinement
- Iterative development with self-correction
- Greenfield projects

**Not good for:**
- Tasks requiring human judgment or design decisions
- One-shot operations
- Tasks with unclear success criteria
- Debugging production issues (use targeted debugging instead)
