This folder is the concise source of truth for building and operating OpenPalm.

2. [api-reference.md](./api-reference.md) — admin + gateway HTTP contracts used by UI/CLI/channels.
3. [development-workflow.md](./development-workflow.md) — local setup, day-to-day commands, debug habits.
4. [testing-todos.md](./testing-todos.md) — all testing action items, test tiers, release gate policy, and CI fixes.
5. [versioning.md](./versioning.md) — release model and version bump workflow.
6. [contributor-checklist.md](./contributor-checklist.md) — final pre-merge guardrails.

## Coverage map
- **Core services:** `core/admin`, `core/gateway`, `core/assistant`
- **Channels:** `channels/chat`
- **Shared packages:** `packages/lib`, `packages/cli`, `packages/ui`
- **Ops references:** `docs/security.md`, `docs/maintenance.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`

## v0.3.0 notes reflected in these docs
- Core services live under `core/*` (admin, gateway, assistant).
- Stack configuration is YAML-first (`openpalm.yaml`), with no JSON stack-spec bridges.
- Runtime artifacts are rooted in STATE/DATA contracts and generated by shared lib code.
- Tests are tiered: `test:ci` (hermetic), `test:ui` (Bun + Playwright), `test:docker` (Docker integration).
