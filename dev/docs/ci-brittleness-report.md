# CI & Test Brittleness Report

Moved to `dev/docs/testing-todos.md`.

That document contains all action items from this report under the "CI Infrastructure Fixes" section, organised by priority: test isolation and environment guards (CI-A), workflow safeguards (CI-B), Dockerfile stability (CI-C), dependency hygiene (CI-D), and workflow deduplication (CI-E). The metrics table is also preserved there.
