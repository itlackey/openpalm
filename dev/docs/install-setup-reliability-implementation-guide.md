# Install/Setup Reliability Implementation Guide

Moved to `dev/docs/testing-todos.md`.

That document contains all action items from this guide: harness skeleton modules (Phase 4-B), scenario isolation requirements (Phase 3-B), scenario matrix (Phase 3-C), artifact standards (Phase 3-D), and the step-by-step implementation plan (Phases 1–4).
