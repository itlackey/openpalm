# ISSUE-12: Minimal Compose Declares Unused `channel_net` Network

**Severity:** LOW  
**Priority:** Post-v1  
**Effort:** XS — remove two lines

## Problem Summary

The minimal compose written at `install.ts:319-321` declares a `channel_net` network, but no service in the minimal compose uses it. Only `caddy` and `admin` are present and both are on `assistant_net` only. Some Docker Compose versions emit a warning for declared but unused networks.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Remove channel_net from minimal compose network declarations

**File:** `packages/cli/src/commands/install.ts:319-321`

The current networks block at the end of the minimal compose string is:

```yaml
networks:
  channel_net:
  assistant_net:
```

Change to:

```yaml
networks:
  assistant_net:
```

This is safe because:
- The minimal compose only runs `caddy` and `admin`, neither of which uses `channel_net`
- The full stack compose (generated by `stack-generator.ts` and written to the same file during `setup.complete`) will re-declare `channel_net` when channels are added
- Docker Compose replaces the entire file on each `up` invocation; network declarations in the old file don't carry over

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `packages/cli/src/commands/install.ts` | Remove `channel_net:` line from minimal compose networks block |

## Testing

1. Run `bun test` — ensure no regressions
2. Manual test: run `openpalm install` → verify no Docker Compose warning about unused networks
3. Verify: after setup wizard completes and full compose is generated, channels still work (channel_net is declared in full compose)

## Dependencies

None — standalone cleanup.
