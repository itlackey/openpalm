# UI Testing Improvement Report: Setup Wizard & Install Flow

Moved to `dev/docs/testing-todos.md`.

That document contains all action items from this report: component test replacements (Phase 2-A), SetupManager edge cases (Phase 2-B), MSW integration (Phase 2-C), component CI workflow (Phase 2-D), regression test migration (Phase 2-E), Docker E2E gate (Phase 3-A), failure-matrix scenarios (Phase 3-C), artifact validation (Phase 3-D), and visual regression (Phase 3-E). The test matrix and per-scenario coverage table are preserved in the new document's tier reference and phase items.
