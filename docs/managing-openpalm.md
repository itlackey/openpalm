# Managing OpenPalm — TLDR

This document covers day-to-day administration: configuration, channels, secrets,
access control, and extensions. For architecture rationale see
[core-principles.md](./core-principles.md).

---

## One Rule to Remember

**`~/.config/openpalm/` is the only directory you ever edit.**

The admin reads your files from there, assembles them into a runtime in
`~/.local/state/openpalm/`, and hands everything to Docker and Caddy. You never
edit STATE_HOME or DATA_HOME directly.

---

## Directory Map

```

│   ├── chat.yml             # Compose overlay (required per channel)
│   ├── chat.caddy           # Caddy HTTP route (optional)
│   ├── telegram.yml
│   └── telegram.caddy

~/.local/state/openpalm/     ← SYSTEM WRITES THIS (don't edit unless you know what you're doing)
~/.local/share/openpalm/     ← CONTAINER DATA (don't touch, ever)
```

---

## Secrets (`secrets.env`)

User-managed secrets live in this file. The admin seeds it on first install;
edit it directly to update admin auth and LLM provider keys.

```env
# ~/.config/openpalm/secrets.env
# ONLY these keys belong here — nothing else.

ADMIN_TOKEN=<token>

# LLM provider keys (assistant uses these — at least one required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
```

By convention, only `ADMIN_TOKEN` and LLM provider keys belong here.
System-managed values (`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `CHANNEL_*_SECRET`, `OPENPALM_*`
infrastructure vars) are generated by the admin and written into
`~/.local/state/openpalm/artifacts/stack.env` — you don't need to set them.
You may add extra variables if needed; `secrets.env` is copied as-is into the
staged artifacts.

**After editing** — changes are not active until you apply:

```bash
# Restart admin to trigger automatic apply, OR
# call the apply endpoint directly:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/admin/install \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

LLM provider keys and related connection settings can also be managed via the
Connections API or the Connections settings page in the admin UI — no manual
file editing required. The API patches `secrets.env` in-place, preserving all
other keys.

```bash
# View current connection settings (keys are masked in the response)
curl http://localhost:8100/admin/connections \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Update one or more keys
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/admin/connections \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."}'

# Check if at least one provider key is configured
curl http://localhost:8100/admin/connections/status \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

---

## Channels

A channel is a `.yml` compose overlay (required) plus an optional `.caddy` route.

### Install a channel from the registry

Available channels can be installed via the admin API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/admin/channels/install \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"channel": "chat"}'
```

This copies the channel files from the registry to `~/.config/openpalm/channels/`,
generates an HMAC secret, stages artifacts, and starts the channel.

### Add a channel manually

1. Drop `<name>.yml` into `~/.config/openpalm/channels/`
2. Optionally drop `<name>.caddy` for HTTP access through Caddy
3. Apply (restart admin or POST to `/admin/install`)

### Uninstall a channel

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/admin/channels/uninstall \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"channel": "chat"}'
```

Or manually: remove (or rename) its `.yml` from `channels/` and apply.

### HTTP routing per channel

| File present? | Result |
|---|---|
| No `.caddy` file | Channel is Docker-network only — no HTTP route |
| `.caddy` with `import lan_only` | LAN-restricted HTTP route |
| `.caddy` with `import public_access` | Publicly accessible HTTP route |
| `.caddy` with no import statement | Admin auto-adds `import lan_only` (LAN by default) |

---

## Automations

You can schedule recurring tasks — like backups, cleanup scripts, or health checks —
by dropping a `.yml` file into `~/.config/openpalm/automations/`.

Automations run in-process using the Croner scheduler (no system cron required).
The admin container does not need root privileges.

### How to add an automation

1. Create a `.yml` file in `~/.config/openpalm/automations/`
2. Define a schedule and action (see format below)
3. Restart admin to activate: `docker compose restart admin`

**Example** — pull the latest container images every Sunday at 3 AM:

```yaml
# ~/.config/openpalm/automations/update-containers.yml
name: Update Containers
description: Pull latest images and recreate containers weekly
schedule: weekly-sunday-3am
enabled: true

action:
  type: api
  method: POST
  path: /admin/containers/pull
  timeout: 300000
```

OpenPalm ships several ready-to-use examples in `assets/automations/` — copy any
of them into `~/.config/openpalm/automations/` to activate:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `health-check.yml` | Check admin health every 5 minutes |
| `prompt-assistant.yml` | Send a daily prompt to the assistant via the chat channel |
| `cleanup-logs.yml` | Weekly trim audit logs to prevent unbounded disk growth |
| `update-containers.yml` | Weekly pull latest images and recreate containers |

### Automation YAML format

```yaml
name: My Automation          # optional display name
description: What it does    # optional
schedule: every-5-minutes    # cron expression or preset name
timezone: UTC                # optional, default UTC
enabled: true                # optional, default true

action:
  type: api                  # "api" | "http" | "shell"
  method: GET
  path: /health
  timeout: 30000             # optional, ms

on_failure: log              # "log" (default) | "audit"
```

### Action types

| Type | Purpose | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `api` | Admin API call — auto-injects admin token and `x-requested-by: automation` | `method`, `path`, `body?`, `headers?` |
| `http` | Any HTTP endpoint — no auto-auth | `method`, `url`, `body?`, `headers?` |
| `shell` | Run a command via `execFile` (argument array, no shell interpolation) | `command` (string array) |

### Schedule presets

You can use a human-readable preset name instead of a cron expression:

| Preset | Cron |
|---|---|
| `every-minute` | `* * * * *` |
| `every-5-minutes` | `*/5 * * * *` |
| `every-15-minutes` | `*/15 * * * *` |
| `every-hour` | `0 * * * *` |
| `daily` | `0 0 * * *` |
| `daily-8am` | `0 8 * * *` |
| `weekly` | `0 0 * * 0` |
| `weekly-sunday-3am` | `0 3 * * 0` |
| `weekly-sunday-4am` | `0 4 * * 0` |

Or use standard cron syntax directly (e.g., `"0 2 * * *"` for daily at 2 AM).

### Rules

- **Filenames** must use `.yml` extension (e.g., `backup.yml`, `weekly-cleanup.yml`)
- Filenames must be lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (before the `.yml` extension)
- Automations run in-process on the **admin container**, which has access to Docker (via socket proxy), your config, and data directories
- Shell actions use `execFile` with an argument array — no shell interpolation for security

### When do changes take effect?

Automation files are picked up during **apply** (admin startup) and whenever
channels are installed or uninstalled. After adding or editing a file, restart
admin to activate:

```bash
docker compose restart admin
```

### Overriding system automations

OpenPalm may ship system-managed automations in `~/.local/share/openpalm/automations/`.
If you create a user file with the **same name**, your version takes priority.
You don't need to edit system files directly.

---

## Access Scope

Controls which IPs the admin UI and LAN channels accept.

| Scope | Accepts |
|---|---|
| `lan` (default) | Private network ranges + localhost |
| `host` | Localhost only |

The source of truth is the system-managed core Caddyfile at:

`~/.local/share/openpalm/caddy/Caddyfile`

`POST /admin/access-scope` updates that file and restages
`~/.local/state/openpalm/artifacts/Caddyfile`.

---

## OpenCode / Assistant Extensions

The assistant runs OpenCode. Core extensions are baked into the container
(`/opt/opencode`). User extensions overlay on top — no rebuild needed.

**To add a tool/plugin/skill:**

```bash
# Drop files into the matching subdirectory:
~/.config/openpalm/opencode/tools/my-tool.ts
~/.config/openpalm/opencode/plugins/my-plugin.ts
~/.config/openpalm/opencode/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
```

OpenCode picks them up on next restart of the assistant container.

**To configure OpenCode (LLM provider, models, etc.):**

Edit `~/.config/openpalm/opencode/opencode.json`. This file is never
overwritten by the admin after initial seeding.

---

## Apply / Sync

The admin assembles your config into runtime state via an **apply** action.
Apply runs automatically on admin startup. You can also trigger it manually.

**When apply runs:**
1. Assembles `STATE_HOME/artifacts/secrets.env` from user secrets + system-managed secrets
2. Copies core compose → `STATE_HOME/artifacts/docker-compose.yml`
3. Copies core Caddyfile (`DATA_HOME/caddy/Caddyfile`) → `STATE_HOME/artifacts/Caddyfile`
4. Stages channel `.yml` files → `STATE_HOME/artifacts/channels/`
5. Stages channel `.caddy` snippets → `STATE_HOME/artifacts/channels/lan/` or `channels/public/`
6. Runs `docker compose up`

**To trigger apply without a full reinstall:**

```bash
# Restart the admin container:
docker compose restart admin

# Or POST to install (idempotent — safe to re-run):
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/admin/install \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

---

## Backup & Restore

```bash
# Backup: archive config + data (state is regenerated, optional)
tar czf openpalm-backup.tar.gz \
  ~/.config/openpalm \
  ~/.local/share/openpalm

# Restore: extract then restart
tar xzf openpalm-backup.tar.gz -C /
docker compose restart admin   # triggers apply
```

---

## Admin UI & Ports

| URL | Service |
|---|---|
| `http://localhost:8100/admin` | Admin UI (direct) |
| `http://localhost:8080/admin` | Admin UI via Caddy |
| `http://localhost:8080/admin/opencode` | OpenCode assistant UI |
| `http://localhost:8080/admin/openmemory` | OpenMemory dashboard |
| `http://localhost:8765` | OpenMemory API |

All ports are `127.0.0.1`-bound by default. Caddy at `:8080` is the main ingress.

## Common Tasks

**Change an LLM API key:**
1. Edit `~/.config/openpalm/secrets.env`
2. Restart admin: `docker compose restart admin`

**Add a new LLM provider:**
1. Add the API key to `secrets.env`
2. Edit `~/.config/openpalm/opencode/opencode.json` to configure the provider
3. Restart assistant: `docker compose restart assistant`

**Rotate the admin token:**
1. Update `ADMIN_TOKEN` in `secrets.env`
2. Restart all services: `docker compose restart`

**Add an automation:**
1. Create `~/.config/openpalm/automations/my-job` with your schedule
2. Restart admin: `docker compose restart admin`

**View audit logs:**
```bash
tail -f ~/.local/state/openpalm/audit/admin-audit.jsonl
tail -f ~/.local/state/openpalm/audit/guardian-audit.log
```

**Check container status:**
```bash
docker compose ps
# Or via API:
curl http://localhost:8100/admin/containers/list \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

**Pull latest images and recreate containers:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8100/admin/containers/pull \
  -H "x-admin-token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

This runs `docker compose pull` followed by `docker compose up` to recreate
containers with the updated images. Equivalent to a manual
`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

**Docker socket GID** is auto-detected from `/var/run/docker.sock` by the admin at startup
and written to `STATE_HOME/artifacts/stack.env`. You do not need to set it manually.
If the admin fails to reach Docker, check that the socket exists and is readable.
