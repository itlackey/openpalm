# Core: Assistant Extensions

## Most important rules
- Treat extensions as modular capabilities with minimal coupling.
- Prefer small, composable skills/tools with clear contracts.
- Keep prompts/templates deterministic and easy to audit.
- Avoid embedding provider-specific assumptions in shared extension logic.
