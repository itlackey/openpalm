# Core: Assistant

## Most important rules
- Keep assistant focused on runtime/extensions, not ingress or orchestration.
- Keep extension/plugin changes explicit and configuration-driven.
- Preserve separation between assistant runtime data and generated config artifacts.
- Keep secrets in env/files, never code or logs.
